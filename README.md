# python

This is a playground I use to learn python...

First, it contains responses to some questions:

* What is python?
  * types of programmes it can build (web apps, API, etc...)?
* What are the tools/frameworks to use
  * for developpers
  * at run time
* What are the tools related in the .gitignore file?
